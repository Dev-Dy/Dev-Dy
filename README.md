# Dheeraj Yadav (`dev-dy`)

**Senior Software Engineer | Rust Smart Contract Engineer | Solana DeFi | Protocol & Backend Systems**

I am a senior software engineer with **5+ years of professional experience** building **correctness-critical backend systems** and **Rust-based blockchain applications**, with a focus on **Solana smart contracts, secure state machines, and DeFi-adjacent protocol infrastructure**.

My work emphasizes **explicit invariants, atomic state transitions, authority validation, and production safety**, especially in systems that handle financial state or user funds.
